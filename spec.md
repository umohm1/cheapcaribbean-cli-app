Specifications for the CLI Assessment

Specs:

 x Have a CLI for interfacing with the application.
 Users are able to interact with a menu that lists of the available vacations around the world.
 
 x Pull data from an external source.
 To get details on each vacation I scraped the website http://www.cheapcaribbean.com. Users are able to view name, destination, description and price
 of each vacation.
 
 
 x Implement both list and detail views
 The CLI greets the user using the list_deals method. A list of vacation packages will appear to the user and they are prompted to pick a number
 to view a specific vacation with further details.
